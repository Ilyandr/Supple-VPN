------------------
The Supple VPN project is a service for vpn connections on the android platform. Lots of free servers, no ads and paid subscriptions. The peculiarity of the project is tied to the background operation of the application, thanks to which the service manages your connection for specific applications (the choice is presented in the application). Automatic vpn on/off will let you forget about manually managing your vpn for apps! Google play link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gcu.product.supplevpn
